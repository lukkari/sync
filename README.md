Lukkari parse application. Listens for file changes in the selected folder and ~~posts updated schedule to the server~~.

## TODO

- [x] Implement storage lib (saves app state)
- [x] Open browserWindow only for the first time (when dir is not set)
- [x] When new directory is selected update state
- [x] Watch files in selected directory (not in browserWindow)
- [x] Run csv-parse for changed files
- [ ] Store parsed data in log
- [ ] Show log in browserWindow
- [ ] Show saved watch dir in browserWindow
